PHI - A Bayesian MCMC code for galaxy image decomposition
=========================================================


Basic set up with test image
----------------------------

1) Clone the code and test files from https://github.com/SEDMORPH/PHI. This contains:

Code: phi.pro

Directories: inputs, outputs, sample

2) Ensure you have the correct IDL libraries installed and that these are included in your IDL path:
* The IDL astronomy users library https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/
* The Coyote IDL libary  http://www.idlcoyote.com/documents/programs.php#COYOTE_LIBRARY_DOWNLOAD

Here is an example of what your path might look like on a mac running bash shell. Here it points firstly to my personal IDL code, then the IDL-Astro library, then the Coyote library, then the core IDL libraries. This is the order in which IDL will look for code (after looking in the current directory). 

mycomputer:~ milou$ echo $IDL_PATH
+/Users/milou/idl/pro:+/Users/milou/idl/astron:+/Users/milou/idl/coyote:+/Applications/itt/idl

3) Open IDL in the same directory as you have put the code and run PHI:
   IDL> phi

Hopefully you will obtain the following files in output:
ChainInfo.sav
Pre_Trace.sav
TraceHistory.sav
[filename]_dataout.fits - contains the parameters and likelihoods
PHI_info.dat - basic chain info for each image


Basic plotting of test image results
------------------------------------



Adding your own files
---------------------

1) Open the setup.txt file in /inputs and set the relevant parameters for your data. 

2) Put the images in /sample and create list of files and initial starting parameters in images.txt

3) Put the masks in /inputs/Masks and create list of files in Masks.txt

4) Put the error images in /inputs/weights and create list of files in weights.txt

5) Ensure your PSF file is in /inputs/PSF (if you are using one)
